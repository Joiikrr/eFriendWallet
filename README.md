# eFriendWallet
This is a smart contract developed for the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can send Ether to this address but only the owner who deployed the contract onto the mainnet can withdraw the funds. However the owner can set 1 special friend (which will be immutable) who can withdraw as much as he can. It is the real Trust Wallet
